# Changelog

What changed, and what it breaks. Before 1.0 the language may break; it may not
break quietly, which is what this file is for. `/docs/reference/compatibility`
has the policy.

Entries are grouped by what a reader needs to know first: **Breaking** is what
may stop your program compiling or change what it does, **Fixed** is a wrong
answer that is now right, then the rest. A bug that produced a *silently wrong*
answer is listed under Breaking as well as Fixed, because code written around
it will behave differently now.

## Unreleased

### Breaking

- **A JSON number keeps its token's text.** `Json::Number` holds a `String`
  rather than a `Float`. `Json::number` still answers a `Float`, `Json::integer`
  is new and exact, and `Json::literal` hands over the text for
  `Decimal::of_string`. Build one with `Json::of_int` or `Json::of_float`.
  Encoding writes the literal back, so `parse("1e3")` re-encodes as `1e3`
  rather than `1000` — a round trip now preserves the document.
  *Silently wrong before:* `9007199254740993` decoded as `9007199254740992`,
  and `10.10` was never exactly recoverable.
- **A nursery raises `ChildFailed` when a child fails.** `nursery` and
  `bounded_nursery` are `raises 'er + ChildFailed`, so callers must handle or
  declare it — including `Router::listen` and `Router::listen_tls`. The first
  failure now cancels the siblings.
  *Silently wrong before:* an adopted child that raised was ignored, its
  siblings ran to completion, and the program exited 0.
- **`Fibers::wait` answers `Int`** — how many children ended with an error —
  rather than `()`.
- **Build output goes to `<package>/build/`**, named after the package, instead
  of landing beside the source. `khora build .` writes `build/hello.exe`, not
  `src/main.exe`. `khora test` and `khora bench` follow. A loose file outside a
  package still gets its executable beside it.
- **`undocumented-export` is `deny` in this repository's own manifest.** Not a
  language change; it is a `[lints]` default nobody else inherits.

### Fixed

- **Two modules may each declare a type of the same name.** An impl was
  identified by its type's head as a bare string, so the second `Show#Entry`
  was dropped at the whole-program merge, the search returned the wrong one,
  and the call was emitted against the trait's bodyless method — a build
  failure reported against a blank line, in a program that had type checked.
  Errata 62.
- **A `catch` arm may bind the failure value**, which four documentation pages
  already said it could.
- **A `!` no longer takes a pending cancellation before its call runs**, so a
  value just received off a channel is not silently lost.
- **Cancelling a fiber parked on a channel wakes it.** It used to hang forever.
- **`khora test` no longer hangs after a trap in a test fiber.**
- **`Env::arguments()` survives a non-ASCII argument** instead of killing the
  process.
- **Draining a large channel no longer overflows the stack.**
- **`nursery.adopt` in a nested block, then another `adopt`,** is no longer a
  double free.
- **The list combinators carry the caller's rows**, so a raising closure can be
  passed to `List::map` — which the Guide had been showing all along.

### Added

- **A `Char` type, written `'a'`.** One Unicode scalar value in thirty-two bits,
  with the string escapes and `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, `Hash`. `Char::code` and
  `Char::from_code` cross to and from `Int`; `from_code` stops the program on a
  surrogate or a number past `0x10FFFF`, because neither is a character.
- **A character-boundary string API**: `String::is_char_boundary`,
  `next_boundary`, `previous_boundary`, `char_at`, `chars` and `char_length`.
  `String::slice` counts bytes and stops the program when a cut lands inside a
  character; until now there was no way to *ask*, so a program truncating text
  it did not write was one non-ASCII input from dying.
- **`std::schema`**: a `Schema<A>` that describes a value and knows nothing
  about where the bytes came from, reporting every problem rather than the
  first. `std::config`'s types are its first client.
- **A misplaced-main lint.** A `main` outside `src/main.kh` or `src/bin/` is
  reported, which is the convention the toolchain assumes.
- **`Eq`, `Ord`, `Show` and `Hash` for the fixed-width integers** — 28 impls
  that were missing.
- **Auto-import quick fix** in the editor: the compiler already named the
  module, and now the editor can apply the import.
- **A toolchain indicator in the editor's status bar**, showing which compiler
  answered and why that one.
- **`khora --version` carries the commit and the target triple**, so a bug
  report names a compiler somebody else can find.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`, this file, and a public compatibility policy.**

### Changed

- **An impl's bounds are part of whether it applies.** Finding
  `impl<A: Show> Show for Result<A, E>` by its head said a `Result` *can* be
  shown; whether this one can depends on what is in it.
- **`khora new` scaffolds a two-line `.gitignore`** naming `build/`, replacing
  four patterns that named the files a build used to leave among the sources.
- **The trap message is a whole sentence**, written by whoever raises it,
  rather than assembled from fragments.

## 0.1.0-rc.3 — 2026-08-27

The third release candidate. No changelog was kept for the candidates; `git log`
between the tags is the record, and the entries above cover everything since.

## 0.1.0-rc.2 — 2026-08-26

## 0.1.0-rc.1 — 2026-08-26

The first packaged build: installers, checksums, and a release workflow that
compiles a program with the artifact before publishing it.
